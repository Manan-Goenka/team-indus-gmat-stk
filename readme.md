# Team Indus

In this project, I worked orbital mechanics and mission design under the mentorship of the Mission Director of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). 
I created launch date estimates for Team Indusâ€™ spacecraft using the General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) and System Tool Kit (STK) software.

Team Indus is the only Indian private space company participating in the Google Lunar X-Prize competition.
